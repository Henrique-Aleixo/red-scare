1) NONE — shortest s–t path that internally avoids R 

Remove all red vertices except keep s and t (they may be red and allowed as endpoints), 
then run standard BFS for shortest path length. O(n + m)

2) SOME — does there exist an s–t path that includes at least one vertex from R?

BFS recording whether a red has been visited.(seenRed = 0/1) NOT CORRECT

Run two BFSs. Check if there exists any path from s to any red and from that red to t. O(n + m) NOT CORRECT

Reverse BFS Check Ford–Fulkerson and Networkflow algorithms/slides

3) FEW — minimize number of red vertices on an s–t path

Shortest path with vertex costs Treat red vertices as having cost 1, others cost 0.
Transform vertex costs into edge costs using vertex-splitting, then run Dijkstra. O((n + m) log n)

4) MANY — maximize number of red vertices on any s–t simple path 

Longest path problem with vertex weights (red weight 1, rest 0). 
Longest path is NP-hard

Run Heuristic DFS backtracking with pruning or limits
-Maintain current red count.
-Keep best found.
-Stop exploring if remaining vertices can’t beat the best score
Handle special graph classes efficiently

5) ALTERNATE — existence of s–t path alternating red/non-red

Model as an edge-colored graph (two colors) and check for alternating paths.

We found the alternating-paths literature (Bang-Jensen & Gutin; Bhattacharya et al) 
Shows that certain alternating-path problems are non-trivial
Because of that we allocated ALTERNATE as a hard problem.

J. Bang-Jensen & G. Gutin, Alternating cycles and paths in edge-coloured multigraphs: a survey. 
They review algorithmic and structural results on alternating paths in edge-coloured graphs.
